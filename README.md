# Freddo's Bash Menu

Using select to create menus had several problems for me.
+ I wanted the menu to immediately react to first character input
+ I wanted more than 1-9 characters, I wanted up to 26 characters (the alphabet)
+ I wanted to optionally confirm choices
+ I wanted some colour
+ I wanted the quit and exit command to be consistently the same letters (q and x)

So I built my own menu and happy to share!
